# Interact Onboarding Documentation

## Steps to Get Started
1. Decide whether you want to work on the backend, or the frontend.
- Linux or macOS is recommended for backend development. If using windows, you may use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run the backend.
2. Do you want to work locally, or on a server?
- You may use localhost to run the backend, and the frontend.
- You will need OpenSSL installed to run on a server.
